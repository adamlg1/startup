### Playing With Simon HTML ###
   - You can just type in pretty much whatever color you want
   - Save for the stuff to show up on live server
   - Don'tworry about things looking really pretty in HTML
### HTML Startup ###
- Commit after each page
- It is just for structure, it's not meant to be pretty.
- Next time I would probably even make it more simple.
### CSS Intro ###
- Defined by boxes
- Use to make website look more pretty
- Still evolving
### CSS Practice ###
- Font-weight can change how bold the text is.
- You can use padding for spacing.
- pals before marriage
### CSS Responsive Reading ###
- include meta tag in the head element of all your HTML
- Prevents a lot of pain using phones
- fr is fractional unit
### CSS Flex Assignment ###
- Start with display: flex;
- You can manipulate using justify-content, and align-items.
- center, start (left), end (right)
- box-sizing: border-box; includes border in box size.
- flex: 1; Each element will be its span, but the element with flex: 1 will get given the rest of the room
### Simon CSS ###
-  I changed a lot of the colors in Simon. I also adjusted some view heights, and padding to see what would happen.
-  I made the scores chart heading light mode instead of dark.
### Startup CSS ###
- Make sure you have the latest version of bootsrap. Usually, the first one you google is not actually the latest version.
- You can add a border on top, bottom, left, or right.
- Padding can help with spacing.
- You can include a picture directly in your header, and even have a link connected to it.
- Make sure you have colons if things don't work.
- Use the debugger with all the different devices to see if your app actually works on all of them.
- Bootstrap is your friend.
### Javascript Array Assignment ###
- Use the arrow function to take up less space.
### Javascript DOM ###
- "The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement." - Mdn
- Syntax: condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
### Debugging Javascript ###
- Using console log statements
- By writing one block of code at a time and debuggging throughout
- You can use the debugger console window to inspect variables without using the console.log function from your code
- You can set a breakpoint, then refresh the browser. Using the mouse, you are able to see the values of variables at that point.
### Simon Javascript ###
- Dark simon looks a lot cooler
### Javascript Startup ###
- Don't do a  function with no (), it is not fun.
- Fix one thing, then a world of pain comes.
- Call your friends, because after 10 hours of trying you should take a break.
- Java don't care, but it also not caring brings some pain becasue it doens't show errors.
- I had to put in an if else for when the array was empty.
