### Github assignment
    Things I learned
    * Make sure to use the git bash terminal
    * nano command lets you edit text
    * I'm going to mess up a lot haha
    * I went through the assignment twice
    * You can resolve conflicts by following VS or by terminal
    * I hope dark mode works in these notes
