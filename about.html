            What is Gluten-Free Griffin?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Gluten-Free Griffin is a place for family to chat and share tips about gluten-free food.
            As those with Celiac know, there is no worse feeling than finding out you have just ate something with gluten.
            Family is generally unsure, and using google to try and answer their question usually just confuses them.
            This application is a simple solution, where everyone can feel better about what is being eaten.
