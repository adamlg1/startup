  "description": "Have you ever been frustrated by your family’s inability to figure out what is and is not gluten-free, or had well-intentioned relatives feed you food that doesn’t agree with your diet, or arrived at a dinner only to find out you cannot eat anything? The Gluten-Free Chat application helps to solve many of these problems. Family can message to ask questions in a chat setting, add tips of what they have learned cooking, and not have to feel so unsure when cooking for someone on a gluten-free diet. Questions in the chat can be answered in realtime, and all members can benefit from each other’s knowledge by adding tips. In a family with gluten-free members, the Gluten-Free Chat app is a must to eliminate the confusion caused by ineffective google searches, and lack of knowledge surrounding what constitutes as gluten-free.",
